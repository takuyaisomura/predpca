# Predictive principal component analysis (PredPCA)
Predictive principal component analysis (PredPCA) is an analytically solvable unsupervised learning scheme that extracts the most informative components for predicting future inputs. It is a convex optimization and can find the analytical expressions of optimal weight matrices and encoding dimensionality that provide the global minimum of the squared test prediction error.
